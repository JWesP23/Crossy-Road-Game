# Crossy Road Game
A Python Game inspired by Crossy Road that uses the turtle package

## Features

- Arrow or WASD key movement
- Dynamic traffic generation (more cars per level)
- Level tracking with on-screen display
- Game over screen on collision
- Clean visual layout with road lines and lanes

## Controls

- Move the player (turtle):
  - `W` / `Up Arrow`: Move up
  - `A` / `Left Arrow`: Move left
  - `D` / `Right Arrow`: Move right
  - `S` / `Down Arrow`: Move down

## How to Play

- Reach the top of the screen to level up.
- Each level increases traffic density and speed.
- Colliding with a car ends the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- No external libraries needed (uses built-in `turtle` and `time`)

## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/turtle-crossing.git
cd turtle-crossing
python main.py
```
